## Spikes
Here you can find all the spikes for IEEE and some spikes related to finding the roots to a polynomial

### Running a spike

`make clean -> make createSpike -> make spike <SpikeNumber>`

## Standards

All spikes should be related to the program
All spikes should be grouped on category 
     -  spikes should not be placed in random order
     -  categories should have title for what is being spiked (ex. IEEE)
